# Crawler System

This project is a simples test of a distributed web crawler system built to ensure scalability, efficiency, and ease of management. 

## Features

- Distributed processing with Celery
- Queue management with Redis
- Web crawler using requests
- Administration interface with Django
- Database management with MySQL
- Comprehensive logging

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the crawler system on your local machine.

### Create a Directory for Docker Volume

This directory will be used to share the files downloaded by the crawler.

```bash
mkdir /home/${USER}/crawler
```

Start Docker Compose
Build and run the Docker containers.
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Create an Admin User in Django
To create an admin user, you need to access the Django server container.
```bash
docker ps
docker exec -i -t <django_web_container_id> /bin/bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

#### Access the Admin Interface
Open your browser and navigate to:
arduino
Copiar c√≥digo
http://localhost:8000

Add a New Site
After logging into the admin interface, go to the "Sites" tab in the sidebar. Create a new site entry named "Arezzo". This corresponds to the directory containing the extraction logic for the Arezzo site within the crawler directory.
Run the Crawlers
Once a site is registered and has its extraction logic available, you can run the crawler.
